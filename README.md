I am presently completing my Master of Business Administration degree at Carleton University. 

While most of my coursework focused on the Management and Change concentration, covering topics like: 
- leading organizational change, 
- power and influence, 
- negotiations, 
- leadership principles and managing teams, 

and many, many more! I also chose to complete a few electives from the Business Analytics concentration, particulary around project management, business analytics and data science. 

This repository houses the coursework I chose to share publicly, plus my occassional tinkering around.
